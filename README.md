# Spamalot

This is the repository for the Spamalot assignment from the Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

The purpose of this assignment was to build a Bayesian Classification object built into a Pipeline to filter through a dataframe containing various word counts of a set of emails. The objective was to train the Bayesian object to determine which emails in the dataframe (represented as on row of the dataframe) were spam emails, and which were legitimate.

Please see the spambase.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file to see the results.
